# read-qr-code

Tiny CLI for reading QR codes.

--------

## Installation

`npm i -g read-qr-code`

## Usage

`read-qr-code foo.png`

Supported filetypes should be the same as
[JIMP](https://github.com/jimp-dev/jimp). Just a tiny wrapper around JIMP and
[jsQR](https://github.com/cozmo/jsQR). I threw this together because I'm tired
of pulling out my phone just to scan a QR code and then text the link to my
email address so I can open it up on desktop again.
